# Berlin Geekettes Hackathon 2013

My first hackathon in Berlin :)

I and another geekette realized a small web app to help you find and listen a song that you can only remember some words. 
We're using the Deezer API and the ChartLyrics API. 

This application was made in 24 hours and needs some improvements ;)
